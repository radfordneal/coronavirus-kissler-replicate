This directory contains the raw data files, as follows:

  ILINet.csv         Contains the data on numbers of visits for all reasons
                     and for influenza-like-illnesses.  Data comes from the 
                     FluView site, as collected by Kissler, et al, and found
                     at https://github.com/c2-d2/CoV-seasonality.  The version
                     here has tweaks to the column names to avoid special 
                     characters.
                  

  nrevssCDC_ILI.csv  Data file on percentage of ILI tests positive for the
                     four common-cold coronaviruses, obtained from 
                     https://github.com/skissler/nCoV_introduction

  Corona4PP_Nat.csv  A data file with only recent data on coronaviruses,
                     from https://github.com/c2-d2/CoV-seasonality.  Not
                     used here.

The directory NREVSS contains some data and other information downloaded
from the sites in the URLs file.  It is not currently used directly (but
duplicates some information in the other files).
